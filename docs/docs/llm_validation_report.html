        <h2>Interpretation</h2>

        <div class="warning-box">
            <h3>Key Findings</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Per-question variation:</strong> Accuracy varies substantially across the three crime questions, reflecting different levels of ideological coherence.</li>
                <li><strong>Demographics effect:</strong> Adding gender, age, and education improves predictions beyond ideology alone.</li>
                <li><strong>Better than chance:</strong> All within ±1 rates exceed the baseline for random guessing on each scale.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="success-box">
            <h3>Implications for Persona Chat</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Validation of design choice:</strong> These results validate providing <strong>explicit directional stances</strong> from data in system prompts, rather than letting the LLM infer positions.</li>
                <li><strong>LLM useful for engagement, not inference:</strong> The chat feature is best for conversational interaction, not for predicting missing data.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>Methodology</h2>

        <h3>Held-Out Variables (Crime Policy)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><code>V241397</code>: Urban unrest response (1=solve problems of racism/police violence, 7=use all available force)</li>
            <li><code>V241308x</code>: Death penalty (1=favor strongly, 4=oppose strongly)</li>
            <li><code>V241272x</code>: Federal crime spending (1=increased a lot, 5=decreased a lot)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Model Specifications</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Ideology-Only Model:</strong> LLM receives respondent's answers to all non-crime policy questions (~46 variables)</li>
            <li><strong>Full Model:</strong> LLM receives policy questions + demographics (gender, age, education)</li>
            <li><strong>LLM:</strong> GPT-4o-mini (temperature=0 for reproducibility)</li>
            <li><strong>Sample:</strong> 200 respondents randomly drawn from those with valid responses on all 3 crime variables</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Evaluation Metrics</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Correct %:</strong> Percentage where LLM prediction exactly matches actual response (after rounding)</li>
            <li><strong>Within ±1 %:</strong> Percentage where prediction is within 1 point of actual (more forgiving)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Raw Data</h2>

        <p>Full validation results available in JSON format: <a href="../data/llm_validation_individuals.json" target="_blank">llm_validation_individuals.json</a></p>

        <p>Below is the exact prompt sent to the LLM for respondent #1 (Full Model with demographics).
        The system message is: <em>"You are a political analyst predicting survey responses. Respond ONLY with the requested JSON, no explanation."</em></p>
